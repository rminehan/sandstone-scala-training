# Scala Training

Resources related to a series of talks I gave on scala at Sandstone starting late 2021.

The audience was devs with general experience but not much scala specific experience.

# Structure

Each talk has a folder in this directory, numbered by the order the talks were done.

The resources are generally slides and code samples.

The slides are designed to be used with a cli presentation tool `lookatme`.

Demos were usually done using simple ammonite scripts or just using the repl. We used ammonite for scala 2.13 but they should generally work with 2.12. Scripts were run with `amm [SCRIPT.sc]`.

# Methodology

The content is designed to fill the gaps that a self-taught scala developer coming from a java/python background would have:

- advanced scala syntax
- deeper JVM concepts
- functional programming
- more advanced concurrency concepts
- scala libraries like play and akka streams

# The talks

Each talk went for about an hour and was recorded using Teams.

The talks are "company property". Links to the recordings are provided but won't be accessible without Sandstone authentication.

Links to the recordings in Teams are only accessible to participants of the original recording, or people who have explicitly been granted permission.
To avoid having to request access, where possible we've moved recordings to Sharepoint which should be accessible to everyone.
However not all recordings were able to be migrated meaning some Sharepoint links are missing.

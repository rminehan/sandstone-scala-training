# Scala Training

Resources related to a series of talks I gave on scala at Sandstone starting late 2021.

Training is a modified form of [an older training from LeadIQ](https://github.com/rminehan/scala-basic-training),
the difference being that the audience wasn't so junior generally and already had some production experience with scala.

# The talks

Each talk went for about an hour and was recorded using Teams.

The talks are "company property" so the recordings aren't listed here.

# Structure

Each talk has a folder in this directory, numbered by the order the talks were done.

The resources are generally slides and code samples.

The slides are designed to be used with a cli presentation tool `lookatme`.

Demos were usually done using simple ammonite scripts or just using the repl. We used ammonite for scala 2.12 but they should generally work with 2.13 onwards. Scripts were run with `amm [SCRIPT.sc]`.

# Methodology

The content is designed to fill the gaps that a self-taught scala developer coming from a java/python background would have:

- advanced scala syntax
- deeper JVM concepts
- functional programming
- more advanced concurrency concepts
